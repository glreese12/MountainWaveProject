== Welcome to the FirstLook Messaging Service (FLMS)

FLMS is a service utilized by the Analysis Center to manage the creation and 
sharing of Events for the FirstLook product which are exposed in a variety of 
formats through this application.

== Environments
1. development
2. test
3. bi
4. production

== Deployment
Deployment for FLMS runs under the osgeousr user. FLMS utilizes Apache with Phusion
Passenger.  The apache/conf files for passenger can be found in /home/osgeousr/apache.

The deployment directory structure is as follows:
/releases - holds all previous releases
/current - a symlink to the latest release
/shared
	/config - houses the database.yml (symlinked from /current)
	/log - houses the current log files
	/pids - houses the pids
	/system
		/thumbnails - houses the thumbnails used by paperclip (symlinked from current)
		
1. bi deployment
To successfully run the deployment in the bi environment execute the following
commands:
  a. cap bi deploy

The deploy will run against all servers listed in the bi.rb deploy script under 
config/deploy. Note the database is set to no_update which does not deploy code to
the :db role and instead is only used as the source to run migrations against. 
Following a successful deployment migrations will be run against 
the bi database schema and the server will be restarted.

2. production deployment
The production servers exist inside the DMZ so all production deployments must
occur from the gdwsjmplgmt02 host. To successfully run the deploy, login into the 
jump host and:
	a. Checkout the firstLookMessaging project to the /home/osgeousr/prod_deploy directory
	This directory will serve 2 purposes: 1. It will be the directory that you issue the cap
	commands from and 2. It will be the local_cache copy that you deploy to the production 
	servers since they don't have access to SVN.
	IMPORTANT: Check out the version of the app that you want to deploy and put it in the 
	/home/osgeousr/prod_deploy/firstLookMessaging directory (see /deploy/production.rb for details)
	b. cd into /home/osgeousr/prod_deploy/firstLookMessaging
	c. run 'cap production deploy'

The production deploy uses the local copy of the current version on the jump host to 
distribute to hosts within the DMZ (DMZ hosts cannot reach svn.digitalglobe.com). The 
code will be deployed and migrations run, followed by a server restart.

It's important to note that in order to scale this system horizontally, the /dg/local/firstLookMessaging/shared/system
directory is symlinked to a small amount of shared storage (/mnt/flms) this allows us to write any uploaded files to a 
shared directory for all of the nodes to access.  The symlink is created by cd'ing into 
/dg/local/firstLookMessaging/shared and running 'ln -nsf /mnt/flms/system system'.
